XSmarty
====

Smarty is a popular PHP templating engine. Although Smarty is very powerful, it is often used in a non-optimal manner. This is the reason a lot of people hate Smarty. This project is not meant to prove them wrong, but just to show how one could setup Smarty.

Currently, XSmarty contains a smart method of implementing body classes, without using external variables from your controller. Smarty can be used in a MVC project, so hopefully this will get you started. In the future, I will implement view helpers, to ensure clean separation of concerns.
